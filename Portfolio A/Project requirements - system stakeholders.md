## System Stakeholders

### About the Stakeholders (People/organisations/environments affected by the system)
- Clients - Commission the collection of qualitative data bespoke to their requirements, other clients may just use pre-existing collected data. Examples of clients are;
    - Donors (individuals/groups)
    - Other charities in area/sector
- Environment - This would be the area in which the surveys are conducted in. They play a major role in the outcome of the resulting data, but also can then be in turn affected by the collected data. For instance if the environment was to be chosen for future improvement projects. 
- Interviewers - These are local researchers who conduct the collection of qualitative data from interviewees in the selected environment. They are told nothing about the organisation and project whose impact is being assessed, to reduces potenital bias from interviewees.
- Interviewees - Selected at random from the chosen environment, the interviewees provide the qualitative date. They answer a series of open-ended questions about changes in selected aspects of their lives and livelihoods over a specified period. Just like the environment, they affect the outcome of the collected data, but can also be affected by the date.
- Ketl - Is a company focused on data management and helps our client migrate his data to the software MicroStrategy.
- Coders - Take the raw field data and having been briefed about details of the project identifies and codes cause-and-effect statements in the data using the QuiP coding system.
- Reporting - Analysed data can be displaying in a variety of ways to demonstrate the key positive and negative drivers of change, and potential links between project activities and incidental/external drivers of change.
- Lead Evaluator (co-ordinates study) - After the results have been documented... 
- Evaluation Community - QuiP is a new approach to the collection of qualitative date, the evaluation community ensure that it continues to tackles bias in data collection, and encourages real engagement with findings through the use of innovative interactive data visualisations.
