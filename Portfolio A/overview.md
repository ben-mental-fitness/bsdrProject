### Bath SDR 

BSDR _(Bath Social Development Research Ltd)_ is a non-profit research organisation founded by a small team of researchers
 from the CDS [_(Centre for Development Studies)_](http://www.bath.ac.uk/cds/) at the University of Bath with the ambition
 to bring more research into practice.
 
Using the newly developed QuIP [_(Qualitative Impact Protocol)_](http://bathsdr.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Revised-QUIP-briefing-paper-July-2017.pdf)
 BSDR carries out impact assessment research on behalf of charities working in developing countries.

The QuIP provides a straightforward and cost-effective mechanism to ask intended beneficiaries about significant drivers
 of change in their lives, and to analyse and present the data collected. It is used to help organisations assess, learn
 from and demonstrate the social impact of their work. The most important aspect of the QuIP is placing intended beneficiaries'
 voices at the centre of reporting, whilst demonstrating a genuine commitment to learning about what works and what doesn't.
  
  
### Problem 

The procedure needed to produce a visual report of the data is protracted and the quality could be improved. BSDR use
 [Microstrategy](https://www.microstrategy.com/us) to analyse data and create causal chain diagrams. However, there is
 no simple solution to export the end result so currently a screenshot image of Microstrategy is used.
 
 Our client requires a software that will not replace Microstrategy but to improve on its causal chain visualisation
 functionality in terms of diagram creation, manipulation and exportation. It should be exported as either a static image
 file to use in reports or an interactive webpage that can be shared with clients.

### Solution 

Our solution is a bespoke applicaton that will:
1. Run on both Windows and Mac;
1. Be able to import data from an SQL database;
1. Process data and filter it according to selected attributes; 
1. Create several causal chain diagrams from the import data; 
1. Allow the user to edit the diagram;
1. Allow diagrams to be exported as a static image file or an interactive webpage.
