BSDR 
----
BSDR (Bath Social Development Research Ltd) is a non-profit research organisation founded by a small team of researchers from the Centre for Development Studies (CDS) at the University of Bath with the ambition to bring more research into practice.

QuIP 
----
The QuIP provides a straightforward and cost-effective mechanism to ask intended beneficiaries about significant drivers of change in their lives, and to analyse and present the data collected. The approach is designed to help organisations to assess, learn from and demonstrate the social impact of their work. It places intended beneficiaries’ voices at the centre of reporting, and demonstrates a genuine commitment to learning about what works and what doesn’t work. The QuIP reveals what your most important stakeholders really think is significant. 

Problem 
-------
The procedure needed to produce a visual report of the data is protracted and the quality is very poor. Our client uses Microstrategy to analyses data and create causal chain diagrams, however, there is no simple solution to export the end result. The current solution is to create a screenshot image. Our client requires a software that will not replace Microstrategy but to improve on its functionality in terms of creating a visual diagram and being able to easily export it into either a static image file to use in reports and an interactive webpage that they can then share with their clients.

Solution 
--------
Our solution is a bespoke applicaton that will:
1. Run on both Windows and Mac;
2. Be able to import data from MySQL;
3. Process data according to its attributes; 
4. Create several causal chain diagram from the import data; 
5. Allow the user to edit the diagram;
6. Export the result as static image file and/or an interactive webpage.
